## Measurement Anti-Patterns

### Metric Gaming

**Problem**: Optimizing for metrics instead of value
**Examples**:

-   Creating fake LEARNINGs to hit targets
-   Promoting trivial learnings to anchors
-   Creating patterns that don't get used

**Solution**: Focus on quality over quantity, regular metric review

### Measurement Overhead

**Problem**: Spending more time measuring than doing
**Examples**:

-   Daily metric collection
-   Complex metric dashboards
-   Detailed time tracking

**Solution**: Automate basic metrics, focus on trends not precision

### Vanity Metrics

**Problem**: Tracking metrics that don't indicate success
**Examples**:

-   Total lines of documentation
-   Number of TDS files
-   Meeting attendance

**Solution**: Focus on impact metrics, not activity metrics

## Measuring ROI

### Cost Calculation

```
TDS Cost = (Weekly Review Time + Comment Writing Time + Anchor Creation Time) * Hourly Rate
```

### Benefit Calculation

```
TDS Benefit = (Debugging Time Saved + Onboarding Speed Improvement + Bug Prevention Value) * Hourly Rate
```

### ROI Formula

```
ROI = (TDS Benefit - TDS Cost) / TDS Cost * 100%
```

### Typical ROI Timeline

-   **Month 1**: Negative ROI (investment phase)
-   **Month 3**: Break-even (benefits emerge)
-   **Month 6**: 2-3x ROI (compound benefits)
-   **Year 1**: 5-10x ROI (cultural adoption)

## Dashboard Example

echo "│   Quality:   $(grep -r "LEARNING:" --include="*.go" . | grep -E "(cost|time|hours|debug)" | wc -l | xargs printf '%3d')/$(grep -r "LEARNING:" --include="*.go" . | wc -l | xargs printf '%3d')                    │"
echo "├─────────────────────────────────────────┤"
echo "│ Promotion                               │"

echo "│   Recent:    $(find ./anchors -name "*.md" -mtime -7 2>/dev/null | wc -l | xargs printf '%3d')                        │"
echo "├─────────────────────────────────────────┤"
echo "│ Protection                              │"

echo "│   Used:      $(grep -r "patterns/" --include="*.go" . | wc -l | xargs printf '%3d')                        │"
echo "└─────────────────────────────────────────┘"
```
