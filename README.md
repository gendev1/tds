# Temporal Documentation System (TDS)

**"Vibe with Memory"** - Ship fast while building institutional knowledge.

## What is TDS?

The Temporal Documentation System is a living knowledge management approach that captures the evolution of code understanding through three temporal layers:

-   **Present Layer**: Active discoveries and current context (code comments)
-   **Past Layer**: Institutional knowledge and lessons learned (anchor documents)
-   **Protection Layer**: Safeguards against repeated mistakes (patterns)

Unlike traditional documentation, TDS acknowledges that code knowledge exists in different time contexts and should flow naturally from discovery to wisdom.

## Quick Start

1. **New to TDS?** Start with [Philosophy](philosophy.md) to understand the core concepts
2. **Ready to implement?** Follow the [Setup Guide](setup-guide.md)
3. **Want to understand the system?** Read about [Temporal Layers](temporal-layers.md)

## Documentation Structure

### ðŸ“š Core Concepts

-   [Philosophy](philosophy.md) - Core principles and "why" behind TDS
-   [Temporal Layers](temporal-layers.md) - The three layers explained in detail
-   [Knowledge Flow](knowledge-flow.md) - How information moves through the system

### ðŸš€ Implementation

-   [Setup Guide](setup-guide.md) - Getting started with TDS in your project
-   [Tooling](tooling.md) - Scripts, automation, and helpful utilities
-   [AI Integration](ai-integration.md) - Using TDS with GitHub Copilot, Claude, etc.

### ðŸ“ˆ Best Practices

-   [Best Practices](best-practices.md) - Patterns, anti-patterns, and lessons learned
-   [Metrics](metrics.md) - How to measure TDS success

## Why Use TDS?

### For Individual Developers

-   **No Memory Loss**: Your 3am debugging session benefits future you
-   **Faster Ramp-Up**: Context is preserved, not just code
-   **Quality Speed**: Vibe fast, but with safety rails

### For Teams

-   **Distributed Learning**: One person's discovery helps everyone
-   **Reduced Repeat Bugs**: Patterns prevent known issues
-   **Living Documentation**: Docs that actually get updated

### For AI Assistants

-   **Rich Context**: AI understands the "why" not just "what"
-   **Better Suggestions**: Patterns guide AI generation
-   **Fewer Hallucinations**: Anchors ground AI in reality

## The Knowledge Flow Pipeline

```
1. DISCOVER (Present)
   â†“
2. LEARN (Promotion to Past)
   â†“
3. PROTECT (Pattern Extraction)
   â†“
4. CLEAN (Comment Removal)
```

## Getting Started

1. **Week 1**: Start with meaningful comments (Present Layer)
2. **Week 2-4**: Begin creating anchors (Past Layer)
3. **Month 2**: Extract your first patterns (Protection Layer)
4. **Ongoing**: Maintain the cycle

TDS is a methodology, not software. Use it however helps your team.
